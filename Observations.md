1. The campaign seems to have an overall success with Q2 ranking the highest. In Q3, we see a higher fail rate at the beginning. Lastly, the campaign saw a few cancellations and remained live for a short period in Q1.
2. The cancellations of the campaign throughout the year prevents the analyst from fully determining whether the campaign was a success or failure. 
3. With the available data, we could create clustered column, bar, and pie charts. The clustered column and bar charts would be more useful.
