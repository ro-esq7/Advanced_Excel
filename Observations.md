# Observations

## Statistics by Category

![Category Outcome](Images/StatsByCategory.png)

The Theater category had the highest count of successful backers, while the Food Category had the lowest. 

This means Theater's subcategories are **most likely** to outperform the others.

There is no available data for the Journalism category due to a full cancellation.


## Statistics by Subcategory

![Subcategory Outcome](Images/StatsBySubcategory.png)

As predicted, Theater's Plays subcategory had the highest count of successful backers.


## Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Outcome by Launch](Images/OutcomeByLaunch.png)

June had the highest reported backer outcomes.

By end of year, all three backer outcome reports dropped significantly.

The Canceled backer outcomes remained stagnant until July. 


## Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcome by Goal](Images/OutcomesByGoal.png)

The success rate of the campaign backers varies by goal.

### Successful Backers

The highest outcome was for **Less Than 1,000** backers at 71%.

As the goal numbers increased, the outcome decreased.

### Unsuccessful Backers

The highest outcome was for **Greater Than 50,000** backers at 58%.

There were less failed backers within the **Less Than 1,000** threshold. 


## Final Stats

There are outliers in successful campaigns whose number of backers significanly skew the mean to the right. The median therefore summarizes the data more meaningfully.
